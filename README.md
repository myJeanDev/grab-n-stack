# Grab N Stack
[Grab n' stack co-op](https://myjeandev.itch.io/grab-n-stack-co-op)  
A simple physics based Godot game I made in ~10 hours for my friends to play over the weekend in a tournament.  
The blocks are Polygon2D Nodes that use their `.polygon` property (an array of Vector2s) to set the polygon of their body's collision shape. This is an easy technique to get the same collision shape as the visual shape.
